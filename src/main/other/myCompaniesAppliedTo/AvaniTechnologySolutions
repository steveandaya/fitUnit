Dear Sir,
I have just concluded a contractual engagement with Cigna and I'm respectfully applying for the position of Java Developer as advertised on Dice.

I'm experienced on the back-end, middle-tier, and the front-end, and as such, I have used various technologies related thereto. My stint in Cigna was primarily to create reporting dasshboards in Tableau, Looker and Excel. I likewise worked with Hadoop, Scala, Go and .Net.

Iâ€™ve been developing software for over 10 years with small, medium and large companies using various software tools, frameworks and architectures. I am constantly learning and I continually update myself with emerging technologies.  I have since learned and applied other languages and tools depending on the requirements of the task on hand.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your kind consideration.

Sincerely,
Steve
