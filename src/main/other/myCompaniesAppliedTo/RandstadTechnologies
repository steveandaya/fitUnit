Dear Sir,
I have just concluded a contractual engagement with Cigna and I'm respectfully applying for the position of Java Developer as advertised on Dice.

I'm basically a Java/J2ee developer with experiences on the back-end, middle-tier, and the front-end, and as such, I have used various technologies related thereto. During my stint in Cigna I was likewise exposed to Hadoop,Scala, Go and .Net. I have used most of the skill sets mentioned in the requirements for the job in my previous engagements and I strongly feel that I am a good match for the job as can be gleaned from my resume.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your kind consideration.

Sincerely,
Steve
