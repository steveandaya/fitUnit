Dear Sir:
I’m applying for the position of Developer - Server Side Java.

I’ve been developing software for over 10 years with small, medium and large companies using various software tools and various frameworks and architectures. I am constantly learning and I continually update myself with emerging technologies but I am basically a Java developer since I’ve done most of my engagements with it.  I have since learned and applied other languages and tools depending on the requirements of the task on hand.

Attached please find my resume.

Truly yours,
Steve
