Our Philosophy
Brewer Yacht Yards Marinas

We return calls and respond to letters promptly
  ... if at all possible, the same day.

We deal with problems head on, do what is fair for all
  concerned, resolve and move on.

We treat all people with the same respect that we want to be treated.

We stand by our estimates and we stand by our work.

We give good value, not necessarily low prices.

We do not bad mouth our competitors, vendors or anyone else.
We do not criticize, condemn or complain.

We want to build long term relationships with our customers,
   our vendors, our neighbors and our employees.

We are good Citizens.

We treat our employees with the highest respect,
   and we want them to be successful.
Hire right... Train right ... and Lead right.

If an employee leaves our employ for any reason,
   we try to make it as amicable as possible.

We are honest.

We do what we say we are going to do.
